# Welcome!

My name is Will, and I am an emerging data scientist/machine learning engineer.

I specialize in machine learning methods, statistical analyses, and package development, all of which are supported my background in social science research. I'm well versed in all stages of the data lifecycle, and my applied research skills let me explain not just if and when trends occur in data, but also why.

Please see my projects below, or connect with me me on [LinkedIn.](www.linkedin.com/in/william-de-melo-240a151a1)
