# Welcome!

My name is Will, and I am a graduate student in UCSD's Computational Social Sciences (CSS) program.

I specialize in machine learning methods, statistical analyses, and package development, all of which are supported my background in social science research. Not only am I well-versed in all stages of the data lifecycle, but my applied research skills let me explain not just if and when trends occur in data, but also why.

I am currently studying machine learning methods in order to contribute to the [*DeepVerse*](https://github.com/DeepVerseLib) series of neural network projects. Specifically, I am constructing test functions for the deployment of *DeepComplete*, which utilizes an adversarial autoencoder to impute missing data.

Please see my projects below, or connect with me me on [LinkedIn.](www.linkedin.com/in/william-de-melo-240a151a1)
