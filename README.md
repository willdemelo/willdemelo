# Welcome!

My name is Will, and I am a graduate student in UCSD's Computational Social Sciences program.

I am currently studying machine learning methods in order to contribute to the [*DeepVerse*](https://github.com/DeepVerseLib) series of neural network projects. Our aim is to use neural networks to combine tabular and nontabular data in predictions and promote accessibility of machine learning methods to social scientists.

I am most interested in using what I learn in this program to contribute to modern mental health interventions, like apps, websites, and hotlines, where machine learning could play a pivotal part in getting people the care they need.

Please see my projects below, or connect with me me on [LinkedIn!](www.linkedin.com/in/william-de-melo-240a151a1)
