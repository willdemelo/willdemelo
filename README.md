# Welcome!

My name is Will, and I am a graduate student in UCSD's Computational Social Sciences program.

I am currently studying machine learning methods in order to contribute to the [*DeepVerse*](https://github.com/DeepVerseLib) series of projects in using neural networks to combine tabular and nontabular data and promote accessibility of machine learning methods to social scientists.
